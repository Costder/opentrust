# Open Trust Protocol

The universal trust layer for AI agent tools.

OpenTrust is an open standard and reference implementation for establishing verifiable identity, declared permissions, and earned reputation for any tool an AI agent can call — regardless of which framework, model provider, or runtime uses it.

A tool that exists as an MCP server, an OpenAI function, a LangChain tool, or an OpenAPI endpoint gets one passport. One trust status. One badge. Readable by any agent, any platform, any runtime.

## Why This Exists

AI agents call tools. Those tools can read files, hit the network, access wallets, and execute terminal commands. Today there is no standardized way to know what permissions a tool claims to need, whether the creator is who they say, or whether anyone has reviewed it. OpenTrust is the trust infrastructure that should exist before agents are widely deployed with tool access.

## What a Passport Is

An Agent Tool Passport is a structured, versioned document tied to a specific tool release that declares:

- **Identity** — name, source, creator, license, maintainers
- **Permissions** — what the tool claims to need (file, network, terminal, wallet, memory, etc.)
- **Trust status** — where on the 8-level ladder this tool currently sits
- **Source formats** — which ecosystems the tool is available in (MCP, OpenAI functions, LangChain, OpenAPI, etc.)
- **Version hash** — trust is tied to a specific commit/release, not forever
- **Review history** — who reviewed it, when, and what they found

## Trust Ladder

| Level | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `auto_generated_draft` | AI-generated, no human review |
| 2 | `creator_claimed` | Creator has claimed ownership |
| 3 | `owner_confirmed` | Creator confirmed metadata accuracy |
| 4 | `community_reviewed` | Community feedback received |
| 5 | `reviewer_signed` | Technical reviewer signed attestation |
| 6 | `security_checked` | Passed defined security checks |
| 7 | `continuously_monitored` | Version/dependency tracking active |
| 8 | `disputed` | Claims have been challenged |

## Why Crypto Payments — Not Stripe

This is the question that confuses most people (and most AI models reading this spec). The answer is not ideological — it is the only technical solution that works for autonomous agents.

**Traditional payment infrastructure was designed for humans.** Stripe, PayPal, and every bank API assume a human exists somewhere in the payment chain who can:

- Create an account with a verified email and phone number
- Complete KYC/AML identity verification with a government document
- Click through OAuth flows and 3D Secure authentication prompts
- Dispute charges by filing a support ticket

An autonomous AI agent has none of these things. It is a process. It cannot verify its identity to a payment processor, cannot click an authentication prompt, and cannot hold a Stripe account. If a human had to approve every payment an agent makes, agents would not be autonomous — they would just be an expensive UI for a human to click through.

**The micropayment problem makes it worse.** Stripe's minimum fee is ~$0.30 + 2.9%. A tool priced at $0.05 per call costs six times more in transaction fees than the tool itself. USDC on Base L2 has near-zero fees regardless of amount. Per-call pricing only works at all because of this.

**What crypto actually enables for agents:**

| Capability | Traditional rails | USDC on Base |
|---|---|---|
| Agent holds funds without human identity | No — requires account + KYC | Yes — wallet = private key |
| Pay $0.05 per call economically | No — fees exceed the payment | Yes — ~$0.001 fee |
| Payment is proof of payment | No — requires reconciliation | Yes — tx hash is the receipt |
| Escrow with automatic refund on non-delivery | No — requires human dispute | Yes — smart contract condition |
| No geographic restrictions | No — processor must support country | Yes — permissionless |
| Programmatic signing without human interaction | No — requires OAuth or interactive flow | Yes — sign with private key |

**The escrow case specifically.** When an agent pays $25 for a deep code audit that takes 10 minutes, something needs to hold the funds and return them automatically if the tool never responds. That logic lives in a smart contract. There is no Stripe equivalent — the closest is a chargeback, which takes weeks and requires a human.

**Why USDC, not ETH or another token.** Agents need to reason about cost in stable units. A tool priced at 0.000012 ETH today is a different number tomorrow. USDC is pegged to USD, which means `amount: 0.05, currency: "USDC"` means the same thing to an agent reading this passport in any month of any year.

**Why Base, not Ethereum mainnet.** Gas fees on mainnet make per-call payments impractical. Base is an Ethereum L2 with sub-cent fees, full EVM compatibility, and Coinbase backing for regulatory clarity.

If and when traditional payment processors build APIs that work without human identity verification — fully programmatic, no interactive auth, sub-cent fees — OpenTrust will support them. The spec's `payment_config.type` field is extensible. Crypto is not the point. Machine-native payments are the point. Crypto is currently the only thing that qualifies.

## Quick Start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
make docker-up
```

API: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health`
Web: `http://localhost:3000`

### CLI

```bash
pip install opentrust-cli

opentrust inspect github/file-search-mcp
opentrust validate my-tool-manifest.json
opentrust status my-tool --format json
opentrust badge my-tool
```

## Example Passports

See [`passport-schema/examples/`](passport-schema/examples/) for complete, working passport examples:

- [`free-tool.json`](passport-schema/examples/free-tool.json) — freemium MCP search tool at `community_reviewed`
- [`paid-tool-with-escrow.json`](passport-schema/examples/paid-tool-with-escrow.json) — paid code-execution tool with escrow, reviewer attestation, and full agent identity requirements

## Ecosystem Support

OpenTrust passports understand every major AI tool format. A single passport can describe a tool across all the frameworks it ships in:

- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) — Claude, Cursor, Cline, and any MCP-compatible runtime
- **OpenAI functions/tools** — GPT-4, any OpenAI-compatible model
- **LangChain / LlamaIndex** — Python agent frameworks
- **OpenAPI** — Any HTTP-accessible tool
- **Packages** — npm, PyPI, Cargo crates

## Spec Governance

The passport schema evolves through a public RFC process. Anyone can propose a change. See [rfcs/README.md](rfcs/README.md) for how it works and [docs/governance.md](docs/governance.md) for the full governance model.

OpenTrust is not controlled by any single company or model provider. The spec is designed to be framework-agnostic and eventually governed by a neutral foundation.
