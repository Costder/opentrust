# Open Trust Protocol

The universal trust layer for AI agent tools.

OpenTrust is an open standard and reference implementation for establishing verifiable identity, declared permissions, and earned reputation for any tool an AI agent can call — regardless of which framework, model provider, or runtime uses it.

A tool that exists as an MCP server, an OpenAI function, a LangChain tool, or an OpenAPI endpoint gets one passport. One trust status. One badge. Readable by any agent, any platform, any runtime.

## Why This Exists

AI agents call tools. Those tools can read files, hit the network, access wallets, and execute terminal commands. Today there is no standardized way to know what permissions a tool claims to need, whether the creator is who they say, or whether anyone has reviewed it. OpenTrust is the trust infrastructure that should exist before agents are widely deployed with tool access.

## What a Passport Is

An Agent Tool Passport is a structured, versioned document tied to a specific tool release that declares:

- **Identity** — name, source, creator, license, maintainers
- **Permissions** — what the tool claims to need (file, network, terminal, wallet, memory, etc.)
- **Trust status** — where on the 8-level ladder this tool currently sits
- **Source formats** — which ecosystems the tool is available in (MCP, OpenAI functions, LangChain, OpenAPI, etc.)
- **Version hash** — trust is tied to a specific commit/release, not forever
- **Review history** — who reviewed it, when, and what they found

## Trust Ladder

| Level | Status | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `auto_generated_draft` | AI-generated, no human review |
| 2 | `creator_claimed` | Creator has claimed ownership |
| 3 | `owner_confirmed` | Creator confirmed metadata accuracy |
| 4 | `community_reviewed` | Community feedback received |
| 5 | `reviewer_signed` | Technical reviewer signed attestation |
| 6 | `security_checked` | Passed defined security checks |
| 7 | `continuously_monitored` | Version/dependency tracking active |
| 8 | `disputed` | Claims have been challenged |

## Quick Start

```bash
cp .env.example .env
make docker-up
```

API: `http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health`
Web: `http://localhost:3000`

### CLI

```bash
pip install opentrust-cli

opentrust inspect github/file-search-mcp
opentrust validate my-tool-manifest.json
opentrust status my-tool --format json
opentrust badge my-tool
```

## Example Passports

See [`passport-schema/examples/`](passport-schema/examples/) for complete, working passport examples:

- [`free-tool.json`](passport-schema/examples/free-tool.json) — freemium MCP search tool at `community_reviewed`
- [`paid-tool-with-escrow.json`](passport-schema/examples/paid-tool-with-escrow.json) — paid code-execution tool with escrow, reviewer attestation, and full agent identity requirements

## Ecosystem Support

OpenTrust passports understand every major AI tool format. A single passport can describe a tool across all the frameworks it ships in:

- **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) — Claude, Cursor, Cline, and any MCP-compatible runtime
- **OpenAI functions/tools** — GPT-4, any OpenAI-compatible model
- **LangChain / LlamaIndex** — Python agent frameworks
- **OpenAPI** — Any HTTP-accessible tool
- **Packages** — npm, PyPI, Cargo crates

## Repository Structure

```
passport-schema/    JSON Schema — the canonical spec (single source of truth)
api/                FastAPI registry — CRUD, search, GitHub OAuth, badges
cli/                opentrust CLI — inspect, validate, search, claim, badge
web/                Next.js frontend — directory, passport pages, claim flow
badge-generator/    SVG badge generator for all 8 trust levels
manifest-validator/ Permission manifest validator with risk flagging
passport-generator/ Auto-draft passports from GitHub metadata
rfcs/               Spec proposals — how the standard evolves
docs/               Architecture, spec docs, governance
```

## Spec Governance

The passport schema evolves through a public RFC process. Anyone can propose a change. See [rfcs/README.md](rfcs/README.md) for how it works and [docs/governance.md](docs/governance.md) for the full governance model.

OpenTrust is not controlled by any single company or model provider. The spec is designed to be framework-agnostic and eventually governed by a neutral foundation.
